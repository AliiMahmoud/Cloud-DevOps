# Exercise: Configuration and Deployment

> You learned to run the Ansible playbook manually. In this exercise, a CircleCI job will run the playbook for you to configure an EC2 instance and copy production files.


## Prerequisites
1. Key pair - You should have an AWS EC2 key pair already created in your AWS Console, and downloaded to your local mahcine. We are assuming the key pair name is udacity.pem.
2. A public Github repository set up in the CircleCI.
3. AWS Access keys must have saved in the CircleCI project settings.
4. You should have finished the previous Exercise: Infrastructure Creation.
5. EC2 Ubuntu instance - You should have an EC2 instance running in your AWS account. We suggest having the Ubuntu instance for better compatibility with the exercise. Be sure to use your "udacity" key pair.
